
## Deliverables:
    - Create logic using flask to add functionality to store system. Where customers can affect the inventory values 
    - Customers must be able to cancel order, create order, and change order before purchase      


## Presentation

    - add some stuff to cart and checkout
    - show the changes in the values of the store 
        - after creating the order values won't be effected until the order is processed

        - show the changes in the store front
