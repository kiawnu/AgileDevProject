Great job last week everyone!! Everyone's contributions have been great! All branches  have been merged.

The focus for our last week of development will be:
- admin/store edits
- Add to cart/create order for signed in users 
- Buttons: 
	- info -> store from info page
		- if not in store show some error
	- add to cart from info page
		- ^^
	- share button?
- CSS touch ups
- Pytests -> Everyone should make at least 1 good pytests
	- Although we have quite a few, trust me when I say these are good practice, all test/exams for 2nd term python will be based off pytests so get used to them

To prepare for the our last week please stay updated with the trello board. Also, I think we should push to have the website ready to deploy next monday so that we have time to test everything and fix issues.
