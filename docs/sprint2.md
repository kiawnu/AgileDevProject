Hi everyone, 

Great job last week!

Im sure you've seen the post that we do not have class today, so I will not be coming in. 

Here is what I think we should start this week:

- Finish the front screen UI 
- create the store database
	- this is mainly the data that will be stored
- Change the Store front so it is somewhat different from the info page
	- currently, they are the same pages 
- Using JS, route users to the info page that they clicked on 
- ^^^ but on the store page
- Route users to the store page when clicked from the info page
- ^^^ other way too 
- Add to cart functionality
- Create the admin/store page where items can be added, updated, deleted
- API routes for create, update, delete

Everyone should be able to do all but the last task.
These will be added to the trello board so please add yourself to the task you'd like to complete
